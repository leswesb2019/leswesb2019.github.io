			<p>It was originally just thought to be “hysteria”. 
				Ernst von Feuchtersleben first described what is today known as HPD. 
				He described hysterical women as being sexually heightened, 
				selfish and “overprivileged with satiety and boredom”. 
				It is characterized by constant attention-seeking, emotional overreaction, 
				and seductive behavior. People with this condition tend to 
				over-exaggerate situations which can lead to poor relationships and 
				thus depression. They are also highly suggestible and easily 
				susceptible to being influenced by others.
