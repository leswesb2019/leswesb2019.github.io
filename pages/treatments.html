			<p>The Reader's Companion to U.S. Women's History
They previously called histrionic personality disorder hysteria and grouped it with both normally functioning female sexuality and personality disorders under that name. Ways to treat hysteria water massages, hypnosis, and even hysterectomies, the surgical removal of the uterus.
Histrionic personality disorder is now treated with a general treatment for all personality disorders: with psychotherapy. Psychodynamic psychotherapy can be used to help the patient realize how their behavior affects others so they can properly communicate their feelings in a less dramatic way and how their behavior is an inappropriate way to gain the attention of others and manage their self-esteem.
